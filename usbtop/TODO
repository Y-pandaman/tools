TODO list:
----------

 * do some math and tests in order to get accurate values
 * try a signal/slot system in order to update the used GUI as soon as new
   results can be computed (and check its performance)
 * better console interface (use ncurses)
 * make a Qt interface for fun :)
 * windows port
